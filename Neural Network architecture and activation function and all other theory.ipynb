    "3. **P-Relu / Parametric ReLu**: Learn while it trains, alpha changes based on learning, have capability to learn while it trains(learning of alpha).\n",
    "4. **Randomized ReLu**: alpha is defined based upon uniform distribution function. Used in medical datasets.\n",
    "5. **Exponential Linear Units (ELU)**: It is costly in computation. Neurons are not dead here.\n",
    "6. **Swish Activation Function (Designed by Google)**: Designed for application of their algo. basically used for NLP stuff and network greater than 40 layers. It is used as, shall we should select the feature or not. **y = x * sigmoid (x)**. **2 level of feature selector**.\n",
    "7. **Maxout Activation Function**: \n",

    "## `Gradient Descent`:\n",
    "- **Softplus activation function** helps us to remove local minima condition and make global minima better, it smooths the curve.\n",
    "- Model irregular hyperparameters are responsible for model stucking in local minima, hence model do not gives good accuracy.\n",
    "- If data is not well set or it have issues it is also responsible for model stucking in local minima, , hence model do not gives good accuracy.\n",
    "- Gradient Descent is known as the optimizer to Backpropogation.\n",
    "- There are scenerios where you cannot reach global minima.\n",
    "1. **Vanishing gradient** \n",
    "2. **Exploding gradient**\n",
    "- **Momentum** makes the curve smoother which helps to reduce the number of epechs.\n",
    "- **Learning rate** helps us to fastforward our training.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 1. `Vanishing gradient`:\n",
    "- Your weights remains unchanged/saturated.\n",
    "- It happen when you have very dense network/very large network with many hidden layers.\n",
    "- Takes huge time to reach global minima.\n",
    "- **reason**: 1. no changed in weight 2. If there is a lot of bias in the network\n",
    "- Accuracy will not change much.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `Exploding gradient`:\n",
    "- Your model is trying to learn a feature, but the feature weights values are so high that whenever we are going to adjust the weights, the loss value is so high that it start exploding here and there. It never reaches global minima.\n",
    "- To prevent Exploding Gradient -\n",
    "- **Standarizing your data points**: If data is having negative values.\n",

    "#### `Callbacks`:\n",
    "- Will monitor at what point you are getting the minimum loss. It will stop the epochs when it found the min loss as global minima.\n",

    "### 2. `GD with Random data/Stochastic GD`:\n",
    "- Takes samples of data points randomly.\n",
    "- Does not go with all the records.\n",
    "- Cheaper in computation.\n",
    "- Need to keep high number of epochs.\n",
    "- Makes the model more biased.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. `Mini Batch GD `:\n",
    "- Overfitting problem goes away, mostly used.\n",
    "- **Mini Batch GD = Batch GD + Stochastic GD**\n",
    "- Cheaper in computation\n",
